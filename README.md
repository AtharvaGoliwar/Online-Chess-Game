## Upcoming Updates

Currently this project is the update on my previous chess project (Link provided below) 
I made the previous offline Chess game Online and now the game can be played on 2 different machines and I hope it will work perfect for everyone. 

If any errors or flaws in the code or game please let me know
## Important

To make the game work,
First the server file should run in any one of the 2 connecting clients or even if it is running on any third machine no issues. Just keep in mind that both or all 3 clients should be connected to the same IPV4 address so that the game runs

With this your game will run smoothly and you can showcase your chess moves on the board

ENJOY THE GAME GUYS... THANKS! üëç
